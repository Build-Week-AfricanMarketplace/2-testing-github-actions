# @aileron/search

Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant
pieces of content without the use of navigation. Search can be used as the
primary means of discovering content, or as a filter to aid the user in finding content.

## Prerequisites

If this is your first time using an internal package using [packages.aa.com](https://packages.aa.com),
please take a moment to read through the [Get Started](https://aileron.aa.com/developing/get-started)
guide before continuing.

## Installation

There are two ways to install the search package:

```bash
npm install -S @aileron/search
```

or via cdn:

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.aa.com/aileron/search@latest/search.js"></script>
    ...

```
