# @aileron/notification

Notifications are messages that communicate information to the user. There are
two notification variants:

- Page notifications show up at page level and are used to display short
messages; they usually appear at the top or bottom of the screen.
- Title is a required property that can be added through attribute or slot.
- Notification Component automatically creates the expand/collapse feature if body content or links are found.

## Prerequisites
